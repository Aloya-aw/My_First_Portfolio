    <h2>How It All Begun</h2>
    <p>There was a period in the university where I got mugged and hddd my phone taken away from me by a guy wearing a mask and carrying a machete. I guess from the shock of it all and my gratitude for making it out alive, I didn't care too much that the phone was gone.</p>
    <p>Besides, I wasnt exactly expecting anyone to etrying to reach me. The next morning, bored and with nothing to do, I went to the university poolside with a friend, and that's how I met the gentleman who became my swimming instructor.</p>
    <h2>How It Played Out</h2>
    <p>We had a very good friendship and after a year, he decided to teach me for free. I started swimming without help by the 3<sup>rd</sup> day.</p>
    <h3>First Milestone</h3>
    <p>My first milestone was when I ws able to hit 20 laps of 17.5m without stopping for more than 10 secs to rest.</p>
    <h3>Second Milestone</h3>
    <p>My second milestone was when I was able to go a full 50m strech all the way to the 21ft end of the swimming pool.</p>
    <h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
    <p>I'm not a <strong>competitive</strong> swimmer and its been quite a while since I found myself in a pool, but any chance to swim again, I would <em>absolutely</em> jump at it.</p>
